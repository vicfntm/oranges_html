# CSS Task 2

Create landing page with fixed-width content by given example.
You are meant to solve layout problems - exact colors,
font sizes and distances may be overlooked.

Extra tasks:
* Darken main button color on hover by 10%
* Get the first section to always take up full screen height
* Responsive layout - make content scale down to viewport width
(mind the font size)
* Simple adaptivity - get the 2- and 3- column layouts to collapse into
single column
* Add HTML5 form validation
